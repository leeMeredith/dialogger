Dialogger
======================

Dialogger is for individuals that need a simple and effective technique to create any dialog needed in a [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) app.


Description
-----------
Dialogger is made with [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/). Dialogger uses the addons “ofxXmlSettings”, “ofxOsc” and “ofxSimpleSlider”.  By using keystrokes as well as a slider / timecode vinyl a user can address an audio file by millisecond / timecode vinyl for phrases, words and corresponding A-F mouth shapes or any image.

Installation
------------
To use dialogger, first you need to download and install [OpenFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks). You can make a copy of /examples/addons/allAddonsExample/ folder then add the “src“ and “data” folder from the dialogger zip for fast FUN. 
Place your six images for the lip-synching in the directory bin/data/record/dialog/images/(yourMouth).
Place your audio here bin/data/record/dialog/audio/(yourAudio).
